# Project-
Indian stocks data prediction using machine learning algorithum

## Project Description 

Nowadays, increasing the trend of stocks market, cryptocurrency, forex, and many more factors everyone want to invest but do have proper knowledge. We all know about that the machine learning model make a big difference in financial sectors because of the find a solution for investors as well as company. In this project stocks analysis and forecasting I will make and use different timeseries model for predicting stocks price based on their historical data which will be useful for new investor and company. In this project i will made three difrent machine learning model LSTM, GRU and Random Forest.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section I download dataset from the Yahoo finance (https://github.com/DannyP007/Project-/blob/main/Dataset.ipynb). This dataset provide the 7 different features for every stocks such as a Open price, Low price, Volume, and so on. In this data there are 20 diffrent company stocks data.
![ Adjusted Close Price for 5 stocks (Nifty50)] (https://github.com/DannyP007/Project-/tree/main/Images/EDA).

## Technical Analysis

The technical analysis use for finding different chart pattern, identify the trend of the market. In this project i used simple moving avarage (SMA), EMA and RSI technical indicators.
I visuliazation for one stock and apply using group by function through whole dataset.(
